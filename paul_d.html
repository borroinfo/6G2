 <h2> Openings for White </h2>
 
 <h3 id="London"> Introduction: </h3>
 As White you always want to get an advantage with your opening. Atleast thats what all the Books say. I dont agree 100%. Tere are some Players that like to play safe and solid what means they dont wanna play a gambit.
 For those I have the London System:
 </p>
 <h3> The London System </h3>
 </p>
 <p>
 The <b>London System</b> starts with the Move <em>D4. D4</em> is a move which a lot of players play because its also the first move of the queens gambit. Black can response either with <em>D5</em> or with <em>Kf6.</em> 
 In both cases you are going to play the move <em>Bf4.</em> That is 
 the typical move in the London System. If black wants to fight for an advantage he will play D5 (or <em>Kf6</em>, depends on wha he played earlier). He can also play <em>C5.</em> 
 The good thing about hte London System is that you dont really care what your oponent plays.
 So you Play <em>e3.</em> Here is an example: <em>1.D4 D5 2.Bf4 Kf6 3.E3 C5 4. C3 Kc6 5.Kd2 e6 </em>
 When black plays e6 you can always play Kf3. Dont play it before that!!
 On this page i am only gonna covr the move ...<em>5. Kd2 e6 6.Kf3 Bd6</em>
 My recommondation here is to play Bg3. <em>7.Bg3 0-0 8. Bd3 Qe7</em>
 Thats actually a big mistake. After 9. Ke5 they will often play the move Kd7.
 Here you are going to take the Knight on D7 with your e5 Knight. If the take with their Bishop they lost. If they take with The queen they just wasted a Move. 
 If <em>10.Ke5xKd7 Bxd7</em> Your are going to play <em>11. Bxd6 qxd6 12. D4xC5 Qxc5 13.Bxh7 Kingxh7 14.Qh5 KingG8 15.Ke4</em> 
 From there on you should be able to win this game easily.

<h3> The French Defence </h3>

White usually tries to exploit his extra space on the kingside, where he will often play for a mating attack. White tries to do this in the Alekhine–Chatard Attack, for example. Another example is the following line of the Classical French: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e5 Nfd7 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.f4 0-0 8.Nf3 c5 9.Bd3 (see diagram). White's light-square bishop eyes the weak h7-pawn, which is usually defended by a knight on f6 but here it has been pushed away by e5. If 9...cxd4 (Black does better with 9...f5 or 9...f6), White can play the Greek gift sacrifice 10.Bxh7+ Kxh7 11.Ng5+ Qxg5! 12.fxg5 dxc3 13.Qh5+! where Black has three minor pieces for the queen, which gives him a slight material superiority, but his king is vulnerable and White has good attacking chances.

<h3>The English Opening</h3>

The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:

1. c4
A flank opening, it is the fourth most popular and, according to various databases, anywhere from one of the two most successful[1] to the fourth most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. White begins the fight for the centre by staking a claim to the d5-square from the wing, in hypermodern style. Although many lines of the English have a distinct character, the opening is often used as a transpositional device in much the same way as 1.Nf3 – to avoid such highly regarded responses to 1.d4 as the Nimzo-Indian and Grünfeld Defences, and is considered reliable and flexible.

The English
 derives its name from the English (unofficial) world champion Howard Staunton, who played it
 during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant and at London 1851, the first international tournamen
 t. It did not inspire Staunton's contemporaries and caught on only in the twentieth centu
 ry. It is now recognised as a solid opening that may be used to reach both classical and
 hypermodern positions. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov,
 and Magnus Carlsen employed it during their world championship matches. Bobby Fischer crea
 ted a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career, employing it
 against Lev Polugaevsky and Oscar Panno at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal in 1970, and i
 n his world championship match against Boris Spassky.
